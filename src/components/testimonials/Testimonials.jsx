    review: 'Zainab for me was and still is a friend. We came in as a team, the only guy amongst two great minds. We shared experiences, ideas and also confronted problems together. Zainab is good at what she does, a perfectionist. A lot of people do not know Zainab has a playing side at work ðŸ¤“, I KNOW that. We sometimes have misunderstandings, but then we always find a way to move forward. God bless you Zainab, it was great knowing you. Greater heights I pray in Jesus NAME! My GEE!! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜‡ðŸ¤—'

    review: 'As someone who has worked under Zainab, she is conscientious and takes her responsibility seriously, always willing to put in extra hours or go the extra mile to get things done making her very productive, efficient and undeniably the best. I am grateful for the lessons taught, being patient and being an amazing supervisor to work with. I wish her luck out there. Thank you Zainab.'

I am really going to miss you alot. I wish you the very best and Gods favour on your new journey.'
