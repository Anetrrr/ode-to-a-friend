    review: 'Zainab for me was and still is a friend. We came in as a team, the only guy amongst two great minds. We shared experiences, ideas and also confronted problems together. Zainab is good at what she does, a perfectionist. A lot of people do not know Zainab has a playing side at work ðŸ¤“, I KNOW that. We sometimes have misunderstandings, but then we always find a way to move forward. God bless you Zainab, it was great knowing you. Greater heights I pray in Jesus NAME! My GEE!! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜‡ðŸ¤—'

    review: 'As someone who has worked under Zainab, she is conscientious and takes her responsibility seriously, always willing to put in extra hours or go the extra mile to get things done making her very productive, efficient and undeniably the best. I am grateful for the lessons taught, being patient and being an amazing supervisor to work with. I wish her luck out there. Thank you Zainab.'

I am really going to miss you alot. I wish you the very best and Gods favour on your new journey.'

    review: 'It was just about three weeks into my Noemdek journey so I was still very new, but she did something that created a lasting impression, a positive one. One day I came to work using public transportation and my worry was how I would get back home considering the difficulty in getting a vehicle in the area, Zainab arranged a means of transportation without me asking. She saw my need and probably my worry and gave a helping hand, allaying my fears, from that day my respect for her increased. What that tells me is that she cares about those around her and is perceptive. It is just unfortunate that we are only able to have such a short time working together.'
